# Kotlin-Android-App-Template

Note : This project is created in Android device using Termux and configured to make it able to run in it. If you run this project in other platforms, you should remove the AAPT2 overriding setting in gradle.properties. Also dont forget to add your own key for signing the built app and google-service.json for Crashlytics. I use Crashlytics for knowing errors at runtime because I code and build the app in Android. If youre able to use Laptop, you may want to remove Crashlytics and using Android Studio or ADB instead
